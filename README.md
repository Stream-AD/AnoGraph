Existing methods only detect edge or subgraph anomalies. We extend count-min sketch to higher-order preserving the dense subgraph structure & detect both. Our approach is the first streaming method that uses dense subgraph search to detect graph anomalies in constant memory and time.

(a) Dense subgraph in the original graph between source nodes s1, s2, and destination nodes d1, d2, d3 is transformed to a (b) Dense submatrix between rows r1, r2, and columns c1, c2, c3 in the higher order CMS.

AnoEdge-G and AnoEdge-L detect edge anomalies by checking whether the received edge when mapped to a sketch matrix element is part of a dense submatrix. AnoEdge-G finds a Global dense submatrix and performs well in practice while ANOEDGE-L maintains and updates a Local dense submatrix around the matrix element and therefore has better time complexity.

AnoGraph and AnoGraph-K detect graph anomalies by first mapping the graph to a higher-order sketch, and then checking for a dense submatrix. AnoGraph greedily finds a dense submatrix with a 2-approximation guarantee on the density measure. AnoGraph-K greedily finds a dense submatrix around K strategically picked matrix elements performing equally well in practice.
